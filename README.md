# Short_summary_of_-Autonomous_Machine_Intelligence
This repository explores Learned World Models (LWMs) in AI for decision-making in complex environments. It covers action generation, energy minimization, and the integration of cost, memory, and actor modules. It also compares LWMs with embodied AI, highlighting dynamic prediction, hierarchical learning, and non-contrastive methods.
